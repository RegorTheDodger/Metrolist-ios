# Metrolist iOS Preview

This folder contains a SwiftUI preview of the Metrolist iOS experience. The goal is to mirror the Android feature set while providing a native iOS design language.

## Compatibility

- Minimum target: iOS 13+ (iPhone 6s and newer)
- SwiftUI-based layout optimized for smaller screens

## Next Steps

- Hook the UI to shared networking layers (Innertube, LRCLib, LastFM)
- Add background audio, downloads, and sync services
- Integrate widgets and lock screen controls
